Hello! My name is Michael Burgess. 

I am a recent graduate from MIT, now working full-time at [RAI Institute](https://rai-inst.com/) as an applied scientist. In this role, I am working to develop effective perception and control pipelines for an agile manipulation platform capable of completing dynamic actions at high speeds with high accuracy and repeatability.

Previously, I received a Master's degree from MIT, where I conducted research on high-resolution tactile sensing for robotics in the [Perceptual Science Group](http://persci.mit.edu/home) under [Prof. Ted Adelson](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/ted-adelson). During my time in this lab, I developed algorithms for estimating the compliance of grasped objects and created a set of fingers designed to be used across a wide array of manipulation tasks.

<!-- I am currently a Master's student in the [Perceptual Science Group](http://persci.mit.edu/home) at MIT under [Prof. Ted Adelson](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/ted-adelson). During my graduate studies, I was previously a teaching assistant for the graduate course ["Robotic Manipulation"](https://manipulation.mit.edu/) taught by [Prof. Russ Tedrake](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/russt.html).

Last year, I graduated from MIT with a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering. As I continue into graduate school, I am primarily interested in developing new robotic perception and control pipelines for manipulation tasks that utilize information available through tactile sensing hardware. I would like to create robots that can perceive the dynamic properties of the objects they interact with, in order to facilitate multi-sensory understanding and empower more intelligent decision-making. More generally, I am interested in investigating new learning-based architectures for performative high-level reasoning. -->

During my undergraduate years at MIT, I worked as a research assistant in the [Biomimetic Robotics Lab](https://biomimetics.mit.edu/) under [Prof. Sangbae Kim](https://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/SANGBAE@MIT.EDU). I studied how to effectively generate high-level trajectories for a quadruped robot across complex, discrete terrain. 

<!-- Most notably, I developed a "decoupled" planning system that utilized rapid sampling methods to generate a path of footsteps and a formal dynamic optimization to determine a continuous trajectory for the robot. This showed performance improvements over traditional approaches to locomotion planning for legged systems. This project was [my undergraduate thesis](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/151851). -->

Throughout my young career, I have garnered vast multidisciplinary expertise. Outside of robotics, I have had the opportunity to work on complex fluids research projects, challenging mechanical design problems, software development, and more. All noteworthy projects that I've worked on are shown through my portfolio here.

<!-- I'm always looking to work on exciting projects, please reach out with opportunities or questions. At present, I'm most interested in developing perceptive autonomous systems capable to address real-world problems toward sustainability. -->

I'm originally from seacoast New Hampshire, but am now located in the Cambridge / Boston area. In my free time, I love to play guitar, skateboard, and paint.

Thank you for taking a look at some of my work!
