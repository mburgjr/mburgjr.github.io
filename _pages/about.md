I recently graduated from MIT with a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering. Next year, I will continue my education at MIT into a graduate program studying topics in robotic manipulation. I am very interested in tactile sensing based control pipelines. I would like to create robots that are aware of the dynamic properties of the objects they interact with. I believe this would greatly increase the capability of autonomous systems in a real-world environment.

Something about robotics and logistical systems
(Ultimately, I would like to create robotic systems that are capable of carrying out ______)

Throughout my young career, I have garnered vast multidisciplinary expertise. 
Fluids / Mechanical design / Software engineering
This is shown throughout my portfolio on this web page.

I'm originally from seacoast New Hampshire, but am now located in the Cambridge / Boston area. Outside of work and school, I love to play and listen to music. I've been playing the drums since I was a little kid and recently began learning guitar.
