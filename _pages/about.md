Hello! I am a Master's student in the [Perceptual Science Group](http://persci.mit.edu/home) at MIT under [Prof. Ted Adelson](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/ted-adelson). I am also currently a teaching assistant for the graduate course ["Robotic Manipulation"](https://manipulation.mit.edu/) taught by [Prof. Russ Tedrake](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/russt.html).

I recently graduated from MIT with a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering. I am primarily interested in developing new perception and control pipelines using tactile-based sensing. I would like to investigate how we can create robots with multi-sensory understandings of their environment to empower more intelligent and robust decision-making. Ultimately, I am interesting in building autonomous systems that could be safely deployed in the real-world to help smooth logistics and improve the efficiency of infrastructure.

During my undergraduate years at MIT, I worked as a research assistant in the [Biomimetic Robotics Lab](https://biomimetics.mit.edu/) under [Prof. Sangbae Kim](https://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/SANGBAE@MIT.EDU). I studied how to effectively generate high-level trajectories for a quadruped robot across complex, discrete terrain. Most notably, I developed a "decoupled" planning system that utilized rapid sampling methods to generate a path of footsteps and a formal dynamic optimization to determine a continuous trajectory for the robot. This showed performance improvements over traditional approaches to locomotion planning for legged systems. This project was [my undergraduate thesis](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/151851).

Throughout my young career, I have garnered vast multidisciplinary expertise. Outside of robotics, I have had the opportunity to work on complex fluids research projects, challenging mechanical design problems, software development, and much more. Projects such as these are shown throughout my portfolio on this web page. I have the ability to work on the full stack from hands-on hardware manufacturing to high-level algorithm design.

I'm originally from seacoast New Hampshire, but am now located in the Cambridge / Boston area. In my free time, I love to skateboard and play music. I've been playing the drums for years and recently began learning guitar.

Thank you for taking a look at some of my work!
