[Concentrated solar power (CSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrated_solar_power) plants can be used to extract energy from the sun, but require operating at incredibly high temperatures (over 700°C).

During the summer of 2019, I worked as an intern at [Brayton Energy](https://www.braytonenergy.net/) designing parts for a CSP plant. Most notably, I performed the analytical design of an intake header for a ultra-high temperature heat exchanger which transfers thermal energy from the sun to CO<sup>2</sup>.

This part was required to last 30 years and facilitate homogeneous flow of CO<sup>2</sup> through the heat exchanger. Structural and fluid simulations were ran to characterize the part’s behavior over a number of input dimensions (such as intake diameter, fin width, etc). Results from these simulations were plotted to advise future designs.

Outside of this main project, I did some materials research and designed experiments to find the best materials for the heat exchanger.
