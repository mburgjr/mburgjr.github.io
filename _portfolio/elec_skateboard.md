I built a custom electric skateboard in winter of 2019. The skateboard included an adjustable mount that attached an electric motor to the trucks of the board. This mount was designed and manufactured by me. Wheels were connected to motors via a custom pulley system. The motor power is controlled with a hand-held remote controller.

The skateboard works well and can drive at speeds up to approximately 20mph. It worked great for quickly navigating the streets of Boston and Cambridge. However, it is not very robustly weather-proofed... (see tupperware).
