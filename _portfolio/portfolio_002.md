**Tools:** Matlab simulation, Embedded controls, Contact dynamics

We built a hula hooping robot to study the dynamics of the phenomena is humans with an abstracted 2 DoF system. This was done for a course at MIT called 2.74 “Bio-inspired Robotics”.
First, we created a 2D simulation that ignored gravity and imposed contact dynamics between the hoop and a waist contact point. This allowed us to see how a circular or spiral hip trajectory would affect the hoop’s movement. GIFs of this are shown on the next slide.
Then, we built our full system to test hypotheses. This used a linkage system with a servo to control the radius of the waist contact point. A motor mounted at the base spun the whole top linkage system to spin the waist contact point.
We tested circular / spiral trajectories and found that spiral trajectories caused the fastest rise to steady state for the hoop.
