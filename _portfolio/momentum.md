Autonomous ride services (imagine a driver-less Uber) would lack certain human elements. For example, if you left your keys in a driverless car, there would be no driver to remind you to grab them.

In the winter of 2019, I worked with a small team of students to build a modular prototype that could be used in autonomous ride services to solve this problem. A camera was mounted to the back of the car and attached to an external speaker. Using Raspberry Pi and Arduino, this system would turn on when a ride ends and detect any objects left in the back of the car. Then, alert the passenger before they walk away

My responsibility in the project was software and circuit design.
